# Using Statistical Analysis to Predict Wine Quality

This is a project completed as part of the Statistical Science Department at Cornell University during the Spring 2025 semester. This analysis allowed me to utilize advanced data science techniques such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, ridge and lasso regression, decision trees, random forests, cross-validation, and model performance evaluation to predict wine quality scores based on physicochemical properties. The project involved building and comparing multiple machine learning models to determine which approach best captured the relationship between chemical attributes and expert quality ratings.
